# MILESTONES

## PREPARATION

- Familiarization with OpenTripPlanner project
- Introducing yourself to the community and understanding their contribution process
- Creating a roadmap of issues to tackle

## Phase 1: Bug Bashing and Documentation

Close out a few easy issues, contribute some documentation, and get some pull requests accepted! The best way to start contributing to an open source project is to start small. Once you get the swing of things, it will be easier to move on to bigger challenges.

## Phase 2: Tackle larger issue

After becoming a contributor, you will work with the core committers and the community to find a larger task to take on, either by coming up with one yourself or finding a pre-existing issue to tackle.

## Phase 3: Document your experience

Contributing to open source projects is always a unique and rich experience. You'll write a blog post to help others that are interested in contributing to OpenTripPlanner and open source in general, and to document your experience. Depending on the issue tackled, this could a technical demonstration (like a demo site) to show off your new feature.
