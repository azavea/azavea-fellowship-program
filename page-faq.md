Although this fellowship program has a specific term limit, Azavea offers some additional benefits beyond the stipend, including:
- Applicants that live outside the Philadelphia region will be eligible for assistance with relocation expenses on a discretionary basis.
- Public Transit reimbursement: We encourage people to use public transit as an alternative to a car. We will reimburse you for your monthly public transit costs up to a maximum of $230/month.
- Bicycle reimbursement: If you use a bike instead of walking or public transit, we will reimburse you for their monthly bicycle costs for commuting (including repairs, helmet, or purchase price of the bicycle) up to a maximum of $20/month. (Please note that due to IRS regulations, this benefit is mutually exclusive with the public transit benefit).
- Flex Time options: Coordinate with your mentor if you need to come in late or leave early and make up the time when it works.
- Federal Holiday: One day of paid holiday leave on July 4th.
- Paid Sick Leave: One day of paid sick leave is available, should you need it.
