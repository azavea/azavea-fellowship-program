### Join us in Philadelphia for Summer 2017!

Azavea is a B Corporation whose mission is to apply geospatial technology for civic, social, and environmental impact while advancing the state-of-the-art. We are deeply committed to open source software and manage several large open source projects, including:  [GeoTrellis](http://geotrellis.io/), [DistrictBuilder](http://www.districtbuilder.org/), [OpenTreeMap](http://www.opentreemap.org/), [Model My Watershed](https://github.com/WikiWatershed/model-my-watershed), [OpenDataPhilly](https://www.opendataphilly.org/), [Open Transit Indicators](https://github.com/WorldBank-Transport/open-transit-indicators), and many others. We also contribute to a number of open source projects we do not run, and value being contributing members of the open source community.

The fellowship program is 12 weeks long and matches software engineering fellows to open source projects at Azavea.  We have already assembled a list of potential projects, and we're looking forward to hearing about your skills and interests.

During the fellowship, you can expect to:

- Work closely with your mentors
- Work on open source projects related to Azavea's geospatial work
- Work in our office in Philadelphia, PA
- Get paid a $6,000 stipend

#### Eligibility

This is a paid fellowship program opened to full-time or part-time students. Azavea defines a student as an individual over 18 years old and enrolled in an accredited post-secondary institution located in the United States.  This includes community colleges, universities, masters, PhD and undergraduate programs. Alternatively, you may be enrolled in an accredited non-U.S. university, but you must have a valid work visa that enables you to work in the United States (we are not able to sponsor you for a visa or provide travel expenses for travel to the U.S.). If you are accepted into or enrolled in a college or university program in mid-April 2017, when we announce the fellows, you are eligible to apply for the the program, even if you will graduate during the program. You must be available to work at the Azavea office in Philadelphia starting on June 1, 2017.

Azavea may ask you to provide transcripts or other documentation from your accredited institution as proof of enrollment or admission status. You do not need to be in a Geography, GIS or computer science program in order to apply,  but you will need to have strong software engineering skills.
