While this is a temporary fellowship, Azavea offers some additional benefits beyond the stipend, including:

* Public Transit reimbursement:  We encourage people to use public transit as an alternative to a car.  We will reimburse you for your monthly public transit costs up to a maximum of $230/month.
* Bicycle reimbursement:  If you use a bike instead of walking or public transit, we will reimburse you for their monthly bicycle costs for commuting (including repairs, helmet, or purchase price of the bicycle) up to a maximum of $20/month.  (Please note that due to IRS regulations, this benefit is mutually exclusive with the public transit benefit).  
* Flex Time
* Federal Holiday:  You'll get July 4 off.  
* Paid Sick Leave: You'll get a day of paid sick leave.
