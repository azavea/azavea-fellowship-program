There have been recent efforts to use Open Street Map as label data for satellite and aerial imagery in order to train classification models, for example the [DeepOSM](https://github.com/trailbehind/DeepOSM) project and DevelopmentSeed's [Skynet-Data](https://github.com/developmentseed/skynet-data).

This project has many potential components, so if you are interested please reach out to us to have a conversation about what the project would actually entail. Possible paths for the project to take are:

- Contribute to one or more of the existing projects for doing ML on OSM data
- Using computer vision techniques to create well-labeled training data for use with various ML techniques
- Creating workflows for training neural networks that do image segmentation on satellite and OSM data.
