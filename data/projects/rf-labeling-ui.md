[Raster Foundry](https://rasterfoundry.com) is an earth observation analysis tool to find, combine and analyze earth imagery at any scale, and share it on the web. It is developed in the open, and you can find the source code here: https://github.com/azavea/raster-foundry.

This project aims to add a front end for labeling satellite imagery for use as training data in machine learning contexts. Imagery supplied by Raster Foundry will be displayed on a web map in this UI. The tool will then allow users to label individual pixels of imagery as cloud, building, roads, and other classificaitons. This classification data will then be sent back to Raster Foundry to be saved.
