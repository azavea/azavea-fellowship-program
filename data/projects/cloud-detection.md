At Azavea, we have been researching the use of convolutional neural networks for image segmentation on aerial imagery (see https://github.com/azavea/keras-semantic-segmentation). This project will expand this research to use CNNs, or possibly RNNs over temporal imagery, to classify cloud cover in RGB images.

#### Milestones

##### PREPARATION

- Determine the project roadmap.
- Getting familiar with existing keras image segmentation code

##### CODING PHASE 1

- Modify existing keras image segmentation codebase to train on imagery

##### CODING PHASE 2

- Development and evaluation of NN architectures for identifying clouds in RGB imagery
- Developing a workflow for classifying clouds in imagery based on trained models.

##### CODING PHASE 3

- Documenting and publish results
